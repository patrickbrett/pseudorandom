# Pseudorandom number generators

Experimenting with the following algorithms for pseudorandom number generation (ranked from simplest to most complex):

- Middle square method
- Linear congruential generator
- Permuted congruential generator
- Mersenne Twister (the state of the art from 1997 - 2014)

There are other, more modern algorithms with better properties (speed, robustness etc). Perhaps a project for another time ðŸ˜Š
